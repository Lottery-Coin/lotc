# Lottery Coin

**About**
Lottery Coin is a crypto currency concept that uses a Proof of Entry concept to verify a block before it is created. Instead of mining blocks by generating hashes requiring expensive and electricity hogging equipment a user with a wallet need only enter the lottery for a chance at the block reward/jackpot.

**Entering the lottery**: Every wallet is entitled to one free entry every hour, additional entries are paid costing one LOTC for the first paid entry and the amount doubles each addtional paid entry. There must be funds available in order to pay for an entry.

Entries are made by selecting 11 numbers from 1 to 144 and a 12th number that is one of the previous 11 numbers. The first eleven numbers are non-repeating. Wallets can randomly generate the numbers for an entry if so desired.

**Reward/Jackpot**: Every hour the blockchain draws 12 numbers just like a lottery and entries are accepted up until three minutes before the draw. Any entries made during that three minute window will be rejected automatically. A reward of 64 LOTC is added to the jackpot plus all paid entries.

After the draw, the entries with all 12 numbers will receive the jackpot. If there are no jackpot winners then the entries with any of the 11 numbers drawn will receive one-half of the jackpot. If there are still no winners then entries with with any 10 of the numbers drawn will receive one-fourth of the jackpot. If there are still no winners then four entries will be randomly selected the first one will receive 4 LOTC, the next will get 3, then 2, and finally 1.

If after seven days no entry has won the jackpot then 1,000 LOTC will be set aside from the jackpot and every wallet will receive one free entry to a random drawing at the end of the next seven days. No paid entries are allowed for this drawing and each wallet will have only one entry to this drawing. For the drawing there will be four winners each will receive 400, 300, 200, and 100 respectively.

**Proof of Entry**: Each entry from a wallet is signed and verified by the blockchain before a payout or transaction is added to the newly created block. Paid entries do not guarantee or increase the chances of winning a payout from the jackpot, but a paid entry does guarantee instant confirmation. A proof of entry is generated each time and entry is made for an upcomming draw.

**Payouts**: Entry winners are paid with eight confirmations from the blockchain unless the winning entry is a paid entry then payout is instant. Multiple winners split the payout.

**Fees**: Entries do not pay fees, but clients serving as a node may charge a fee upto 0.04 LOTC for verification of payments. Payouts from the jackpot are not charged a fee. The payee pays the fee.

**Spendable funds**: Funds are transfered instantly or nearly so but do not become spendable until added to the blockchain.
